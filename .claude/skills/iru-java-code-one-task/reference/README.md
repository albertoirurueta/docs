# Java development reference

General Java code agreements for implementing a task in a plain Java/Maven project — the conventions this
catalog expects, independent of any framework. These files exist so `iru-java-code-one-task` can load **only**
what the task in front of it actually needs, instead of carrying every rule in context on every task.

For a Spring Boot service, the equivalent (and additional, architecture-specific) guidance lives in
`iru-java-springboot-code-one-task/reference/` instead — hexagonal module boundaries, DDD tactical patterns,
SOLID, and the distributed patterns. Everything in *this* directory still holds there; nothing here contradicts
it.

## Read this much, and no more

| Read | When |
|---|---|
| `code-style.md` | **Always.** Type inference (`var`), `final` wherever possible, immutability, visibility, naming, exceptions. |
| `class-member-ordering.md` | The task adds a new type, or adds/moves a constant, field, constructor, method, or nested type in an existing one. Skip it only for a change that stays inside an existing method body. |
| `javadoc.md` | The task adds or changes a type, or any public/protected member. |
| `testing.md` | The task writes or updates tests — which is nearly every task, since writing the tests is part of implementing it. |

A task that only changes logic inside one existing method needs `code-style.md` plus `testing.md`, and nothing
else. Don't read the rest speculatively.

## The three rules that override everything else

1. **Match the surrounding code.** Every rule here is the default for *new* code. If the file or package you're
   editing consistently does something else, follow it and note the divergence in the report rather than
   converting the file to this document's preference as a side effect of an unrelated task. Reordering or
   restyling untouched code turns a two-line change into an unreviewable diff.
2. **A task implements what the task says.** These references tell you *how* to write what was asked for. They
   never license adding an abstraction, an interface, a builder, or a "while I'm here" refactor the plan didn't
   ask for.
3. **This skill doesn't validate.** It never runs the test suite, coverage, code-quality checks, license
   headers, or a Javadoc audit — the calling `iru-java-code-one-task-group` does all of that once for the whole
   task group. Write code that will pass those gates; don't run them here.

precedence where they are stricter (notably on `final`, on `var`, and on the public-to-private declaration
order, which most published style guides leave unspecified).
